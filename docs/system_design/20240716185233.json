{"Implementation approach":"We will use the Go programming language to implement the movie recommendation system. The system will be designed around the concept of a user-reviewer alignment matrix, which will be updated every time a user completes a questionnaire. The matrix will be used to generate personalized movie recommendations. We will use the gorilla/mux library for routing and handling HTTP requests, and the gorm library for object-relational mapping to interact with the database. The app will be designed with a focus on simplicity and user experience.","File list":["main.go","recommendation.go","questionnaire.go","user.go","reviewer.go","alignment.go"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -Router router\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class Router {\n        -Recommendation recommendation\n        -Questionnaire questionnaire\n        -User user\n        -Reviewer reviewer\n        -Alignment alignment\n        +route() str\n    }\n    class Recommendation {\n        +generate() list\n    }\n    class Questionnaire {\n        +create() str\n        +submit() str\n    }\n    class User {\n        +login() str\n        +logout() str\n        +register() str\n    }\n    class Reviewer {\n        +getReviews() list\n    }\n    class Alignment {\n        +update() str\n        +getAlignment() float\n    }\n    Main --> Router\n    Router --> Recommendation\n    Router --> Questionnaire\n    Router --> User\n    Router --> Reviewer\n    Router --> Alignment\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant R as Router\n    participant Re as Recommendation\n    participant Q as Questionnaire\n    participant U as User\n    participant Rev as Reviewer\n    participant A as Alignment\n    M->>R: route()\n    R->>U: login()\n    U-->>R: return user\n    R->>Re: generate(user)\n    Re-->>R: return recommendations\n    R->>Q: create(user)\n    Q-->>R: return questionnaire\n    R->>A: update(user, questionnaire)\n    A-->>R: return updated alignment\n    R->>Rev: getReviews(user)\n    Rev-->>R: return reviews\n    R-->>M: return recommendations, questionnaire, alignment, reviews\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specifics of the questionnaire and how it will be used to update the user-reviewer alignment matrix."}
